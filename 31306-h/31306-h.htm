<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p><i>The outcasts; the hunted of all the brighter worlds, crowded onto
Yaroto. But even here was there salvation for Ransome, the jinx-scarred
acolyte, when tonight was the night of Bani-tai ... the
night of expiation by the photo-memoried priests of dark Darion?</i></p></div>

<p>he last light in the Galaxy was a
torch. High in the rafters of Mytor's
Cafe Yaroto it burned, and its red
glare illuminated a gallery of the damned.
Hands that were never far from blaster or
knife; eyes that picked a hundred private
hells out of the swirling smoke where a
woman danced.</p>

<p>She was good to look at, moving in time
to the savage rhythm of the music. The
single garment she wore bared her supple
body, and thighs and breasts and a cloud of
dark hair wove a pattern of desire in the
close room.</p>

<p>Fat Mytor watched, and his little crafty
eyes gleamed. The Earth-girl danced like a
she-devil tonight. The tables were crowded
with the outcast and the hunted of all the
brighter worlds. The woman's warm body,
moving in the torchlight, would stir memories
that men had thought they left light
years behind. Gold coins would shower into
Mytor's palm for bad wine, for stupor and
forgetfulness.</p>

<p>Mytor sipped his imported amber kali,
and the black eyes moved with seeming
casualness, penetrating the deep shadows
where the tables were, resting briefly on
each drunken, greedy or fear-ridden face.</p>

<p>It was an old process with Mytor, nearly
automatic. A glance told him enough, the
state of a man's mind and senses and wallet.
This trembling wreck, staring at the woman
and nursing a glass of the cheapest green
Yarotian wine, had spent his last silver.
Mytor would have him thrown out. Another,
head down and muttering over a
tumbler of raw whiskey, would pass out
before the night was over, and wake in an
alley blocks away, with his gold in Mytor's
pocket. A third wanted a woman, and
Mytor knew what kind of a woman.</p>

<p>When the dance was nearly over Mytor
heaved out of his chair, drew the rich
folds of his native Venusian tarab about his
bulk, and padded softly to a corner of the
room, where the shadows lay deepest.
Smiling, he rested a moist, jeweled paw on
the table at which Ransome, the Earthman,
sat alone.</p>

<p>Blue eyes looked up coldly out of a weary,
lean face. The voice was bored.</p>

<p>"I've paid for my bottle and I have nothing
left for you to steal. We have nothing
in common, no business together. Now, if
you don't mind, you're in my line of vision,
and I'd like to watch the finish of the
dance."</p>

<p>The fat Venusian's smile only broadened.</p>

<p>"May I sit down, Mr. Ransome?" he persisted.
"Here, out of your line of vision?"</p>

<p>"The chair belongs to you," Ransome observed
flatly.</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Covertly, as he had done for hours now,
Mytor studied the gaunt, pale Earthman in
the worn space harness. Ransome had apparently
dismissed the Venusian renegade
already, and his cold blue eyes followed the
woman's every movement with fixed intensity.</p>

<p>The music swept on toward its climax and
the woman's body was a storm of golden
flesh and tossing black hair. Mytor saw the
Earthman's pale lips twist in the faint suggestion
of a bitter smile, saw the long
fingers tighten around the glass.</p>

<p>Every man had his price on Yaroto, and
Ransome would not be the first Mytor had
bought with a woman. For a moment, Mytor
watched the desire brighten in Ransome's
eyes, studied the smile that some men wear
on the way to death, in the last moment
when life is most precious.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_i.jpg" alt="I" width="16" height="40" /></div>
<p>n this moment Ransome was for sale.
And Mytor had a proposition.</p>

<p>"You were not surprised that I knew your
name, Mr. Ransome?"</p>

<p>"Let's say that I wasn't interested."</p>

<p>Mytor flushed but Ransome was looking
past him at the woman. The Venusian wiped
his forehead with a soiled handkerchief,
drummed fat fingers on the table for a moment,
tried a different tack.</p>

<p>"Her name is Irene. She's lovely, isn't
she, Mr. Ransome? Surely the inner worlds
showed you nothing like her. The eyes,
the red mouth, the breasts like&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Shut up," Ransome grated, and the glass
shattered between his clenched fingers.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Ransome." Whiskey
trickled from the edge of the table in slow,
thick drops, staining Mytor's white tarab.
Ice was in the Venusian's voice. "Get out
of my place&mdash;now. Leave the whiskey, and
the woman. I have no traffic with fools."</p>

<p>Ransome sighed.</p>

<p>"I've told you, Mytor that you're wasting
your time. But make your pitch, if you
must."</p>

<p>"Ah, Mr. Ransome, you do not care to
go out into the starless night. Perhaps there
are those who wait for you, eh? With very
long knives?"</p>

<p>Reflex brought Ransome's hand up in a
lightning arc to the blaster bolstered under
his arm, but Mytor's damp hand was on his
wrist, and Mytor's purr was in his ear, the
words coming quickly.</p>

<p>"You would die where you sit, you
fool. You would not live even to know the
sharpness of the long knives, the sacred
knives of Darion, with the incantations inscribed
upon their blades against blasphemers
of the Temple."</p>

<p>Ransome shuddered and was silent. He
saw Mytor's guards, vigilant in the shadows,
and his hand fell away from the blaster.</p>

<p>When the dance was ended, and the
blood was running hot and strong in him,
he turned to face Mytor. His voice was
impatient now, but his meaning was
shrouded in irony.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to sell me a lucky charm,
Mytor?"</p>

<p>The Venusian laughed.</p>

<p>"Would you call a space ship a lucky
charm, Mr. Ransome?"</p>

<p>"No," Ransome said grimly. "If it were
berthed across the street I'd be dead before
I got halfway to it."</p>

<p>"Not if I provided you with a guard of
my men."</p>

<p>"Maybe not. But I wouldn't have picked
you for a philanthropist, Mytor."</p>

<p>"There are no philanthropists on Yaroto,
Mr. Ransome. I offer you escape, it is true;
you will have guessed that I expect some
service in return."</p>

<p>"Get to the point." Ransome's eyes were
weary now that the woman's dancing no
longer held them. And there was little hope
in his voice.</p>

<p>A man can put off a date across ten years,
and across a hundred worlds, and there can
be whiskey and women to dance for him.
But there was a ship with burned-out jets
lying in the desert outside this crumbling
city, and it was the night of Bani-tai, the
night of expiation in distant Darion, and
Ransome knew that for him, this was the
last world.</p>

<p>After tonight the priests would proclaim
the start of a new Cycle, and the old debts,
if still unpaid, would be canceled forever.</p>

<p>Ransome shrugged, a hopeless gesture.
Enough of the cult of the Dark One
lingered in the very stuff of his nerves and
brain to tell him that the will of the Temple
would be done.</p>

<p>But Mytor was speaking again, and Ransome
listened in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"All the scum of the Galaxy wash up on
Yaroto at last," the fat Venusian said.
"That is why you and I are here, Mr. Ransome.
It is also why a certain pirate landed
his ship on the desert out there three days
ago. <i>Callisto Queen</i>, the ship's name is,
though it has borne a dozen others. Cargo&mdash;Jovian
silks and dyestuffs from the moons
of Mars, narco-vin from the system of
Alpha Centauri."</p>

<p>Mytor paused, put the tips of fat fingers
together, and looked hard at Ransome.</p>

<p>"Is all of that supposed to mean something
to me?" Ransome asked. A waiter
had brought over a glass to replace the
broken one, and he poured a drink for
himself, not inviting Mytor. "It doesn't."</p>

<p>"It suggests a course, nothing more. In
toward Sol, out to Yaroto by way of Alpha
Centauri. Do you follow the courses of
pirate ships, Mr. Ransome?"</p>

<p>"One," Ransome said savagely. "I've lost
track of her."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you know the <i>Callisto Queen</i>
better under her former name, then."</p>

<p>Again Ransome's hand moved toward
the blaster, and this time Mytor made no
attempt to stop him. Ransome's thin lips
tightened with some powerful emotion, and
he half rose to look hard at Mytor.</p>

<p>"The name of the ship?"</p>

<p>"Her captain used to call her <i>Hawk of
Darion</i>."</p>

<p>Ransome understood. <i>Hawk of Darion</i>,
hell ship driving through black space under
the command of a man he had once
sworn to kill. Eight years rolled back and
he saw them together, laughing at him: the
Earthman-captain and the woman who had
been Ransome's.</p>

<p>"Captain Jareth," Ransome said slowly.
"Here&mdash;on Yaroto."</p>

<p>The Venusian nodded, pushing the bottle
toward Ransome. The Earthman ignored the
gesture.</p>

<p>"Is the woman with him?"</p>

<p>Mytor smiled his feline smile. "You
would like to see her blood run under the
knives of the priests, no?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Ransome meant it. Somewhere, in the
years of flight, he had lost his love for the
blonde, red-lipped Dura-ki, and with it
had gone his bitter hatred and his desire for
revenge.</p>

<p>He jerked his mind back to the present,
to Mytor.</p>

<p>"And if I told you that it must be her
life or yours?" Mytor was asking him.</p>

<p>Ransome's eyes widened. He sensed that
Mytor's last question was not, an idle one.
He leaned forward and asked:</p>

<p>"How do you fit into this at all, Mytor?"</p>

<p>"Easily. Once, ten years ago, you and the
woman now aboard the <i>Hawk of Darion</i>
blasphemed together against the Temple of
the Dark One, in Darion."</p>

<p>"Go on," Ransome said.</p>

<p>"When you landed here this afternoon
the avenging priests were not far behind
you."</p>

<p>"How did you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have many contacts," Mytor purred. "I
find them invaluable. But you are growing
impatient, Mr. Ransome. I will be brief. I
have contracted with the priests of Darion
to deliver you to them tonight for a considerable
sum."</p>

<p>"How did you know you would find me?"</p>

<p>"I was given your description." He made
a gesture that took in all the occupants of
the torch-lit room. "So many of the hunted,
and the haunted, come here to forget for
an hour the things that pursue them. I was
expecting you, Mr. Ransome."</p>

<p>"If there is a large sum of money involved,
I'm sure you'll make every effort to
carry out your part of the bargain," Ransome
observed ironically.</p>

<p>"I am a businessman, it is true. But in
my dealings with the master of the <i>Hawk
of Darion</i> I have seen the woman and I
have heard stories. It occurred to me that the
priests would pay much more for the woman
than they would for you, and it seemed to
me that a message from you might coax
her off the ship. After all, when one has
been in love&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough." Ransome had risen to
his feet. "I wonder if I could kill you before
your guards got to me."</p>

<p>"Are you then so in love with death,
Ransome?" The Venusian spoke quickly.
"Don't be a fool. It is a small thing, a
woman's life&mdash;a woman who has betrayed
you."</p>

<p>Ransome stood silent, his arm halfway
to his blaster. The woman had begun to
dance again in the red glare of the torch.</p>

<p>"There will be other women," the
Venusian was murmuring. "The woman
who dances now, I will give her to you,
to take with you in your new ship."</p>

<p>Ransome looked slowly from the glowing
body of the woman to the guards
around the walls, down into Mytor's confident
face. His arm dropped away from the
blaster.</p>

<p>"Any man&mdash;for a price." The Venusian's
murmur was lost in the blare of the music.
Ransome had eased his lean body back into
the chair.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_t.jpg" alt="T" width="31" height="40" /></div>
<p>he night air was cold against Ransome's
cheek when he went out an hour
later, surrounded by Mytor's men. Yaroto's
greenish moon was overhead now, but its
pale light did not help him to see more
clearly. It only made shadows in every
doorway and twisting alley.</p>

<p>Mytor's car was only a few feet away but
before he could reach it he was shoved aside
by one of the Venusian's guards. At the
same moment the night flamed with the
blue-yellow glare from a dozen blasters.
Ransome raised his own weapon, staring
into the shadows, seeking his attackers.</p>

<p>"That's our job. Get in," said one of
the guards, wrenching open the car door.</p>

<p>Then the firing was over as suddenly as
it had begun. The guards clustered at the
opening of an alley down the street. Mytor's
driver sat impassively in the front seat.</p>

<p>When the guards returned one of them
thrust something at Ransome, something
hard and cold. He glanced at it. A long
knife.</p>

<p>There was no need to read the inscription
on the hilt. He knew it by heart.</p>

<p>"Death to him who defileth the Bed of
the Dark One. Life to the Temple and City
of Darion."</p>

<p>Once Ransome would have pocketed the
knife as a kind of grim keepsake. Now he
only let it fall to the floor.</p>

<p>In the brief, ghostly duel just over he had
neither seen nor heard his attackers. That
added, somehow, to the horror of the thing.</p>

<p>He shrugged off the thought, turning
his mind to the details of the plan by which
he would save his life.</p>

<p>It was quite simple. Ransome had been
in space long enough to know where the
crewmen went on a strange world. Half an
hour later he sat with a gunner from the
<i>Hawk of Darion</i>, in one of the gaudy
pleasure houses clustered on the fringe of
the city near the spaceport and the desert
beyond.</p>

<p>"Will you take the note to the Captain's
woman?"</p>

<p>The man squirmed, avoiding Ransome's
ice-blue stare.</p>

<p>"Captain killed the last man who looked
at his woman," the gunner muttered sullenly.
"Flogged him to death."</p>

<p>"I'm not asking you to look at her,"
Ransome reminded him.</p>

<p>The gunner sat looking at the stack of
Mytor's money piled on the table before
him. A woman drifted over.</p>

<p>"Go away," Ransome said, without raising
his eyes. He added another bill to the stack.</p>

<p>"Let me see the note before I take it,"
the gunner demanded.</p>

<p>"It would mean nothing to you." Ransome
pushed a half-empty bottle toward the
man, poured him out another drink.</p>

<p>The man's hands were trembling with
inner conflict as he measured the killing
lash against the stack of yellow Yarotian
kiroons, and the pleasures it would buy
him. He drank, dribbling a little of the
wine down his grimy chin, and then returned
to the subject of seeing the note, with
drunken persistence.</p>

<p>"I got to see it first."</p>

<p>"It's in a language you wouldn't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let him see it," a new voice cut in.
"Translate it for him, Mr. Ransome."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_i.jpg" alt="I" width="16" height="40" /></div>

<p>t was a woman's voice, cold and contemptuous.
Ransome looked up quickly,
and at first he didn't recognize her. The
gunner never took his eyes from the stack
of kiroons on the table.</p>

<p>"Let him see how a man murders a
woman to save his own neck."</p>

<p>"You're supposed to be dancing at
Mytor's place," Ransome said. "That's your
business; this is mine."</p>

<p>He closed his hand over the gunner's
wrist as the man reached convulsively for
the money, menaced now by the angry
woman.</p>

<p>"Half now, the rest later." Ransome's
eyes burned into the crewman's. The latter
looked away. Ransome tightened his grip,
and pain contorted the gunner's features.</p>

<p>"Look at me," Ransome said. "If you
cross me you'll wish you could die by flogging."</p>

<p>The woman Mytor had called Irene was
still standing by the table when the gunner
had left with the note and his money.</p>

<p>"Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. Sit down."</p>

<p>"I'd like a drink."</p>

<p>She sipped her wine in silence and Ransome
studied her by the flickering light of
the candle burning on the table between
them.</p>

<p>She wore a simple street dress now, in
contrast to the gaudy, revealing garments
of the pleasure house women. The beauty of
her soft, unpainted lips, her golden skin
and wide-set green eyes was more striking
now, seen at close range, than it had been
in the smoky cavern of Mytor's place.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking now, Ransome?"</p>

<p>The question was unexpected, and Ransome
answered without forethought: "The
Temple."</p>

<p>"You studied for the priesthood of the
Dark One yourself."</p>

<p>"Did Mytor tell you that?"</p>

<p>Irene nodded. The candlelight gave luster
to her dark hair and revealed the contours
of her high, firm breasts.</p>

<p>Ransome's pulse speeded up just looking
at her. Then he saw that she was regarding
him as if he were something crawling
in damp stone, and there was bitterness
in him.</p>

<p>"There are things that even Mytor doesn't
know, even omniscient Mytor&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"You were going to tell me about how
you are really a very honorable man. Why
don't you? You have an hour before it will
be time to betray the woman from the
<i>Hawk of Darion</i>."</p>

<p>Ransome shrugged, and his voice returned
her mockery.</p>

<p>"If I told you that I had been an acolyte
in the Temple of the Dark One, and
that I was condemned to death for blasphemy,
committed for love of a woman,
would you like me better?"</p>

<p>"I might."</p>

<p>"Ten years ago," Ransome said. He
talked, and the mighty walls of the Temple
reared themselves around his mind, and the
music of the pleasure house became the
chanting of the priests at the high altar.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_h.jpg" alt="H" width="37" height="40" /></div>

<p>e stood at the rear of the great
Temple, and he had the tonsure and
the black robes, and his name was not
Ransome, but Ra-sed.</p>

<p>He had almost forgotten his Terran name.
Forgotten, too, were his parents, and the
laboratory ship that had been his home
until the crash landing that had left him an
orphan and Ward of the Temple.</p>

<p>Red candles burned before the high
altar, but terror began just beyond their
flickering light. It was dark where Ra-sed
stood, and he could hear the cries of the
people in the courtyard outside, and feel
the trembling of the pillars, the very pillars
of the Temple, and the groaning of stone on
massive stone in the great, shadowed arches
overhead. Above all, the chanting before
the altar of the Dark One, rising, rising toward
hysteria.</p>

<p>And then, like a knife in the darkness, the
scream, and the straining to see which of
the maidens the sacred lots cast before the
altar had chosen; and the sudden, sick
knowledge that it was Dura-ki. Dura-ki, of
the soft golden hair and bright lips.</p>

<p>In stunned silence, Ra-sed, acolyte, listened
to the bridal chant of the priests; the
ancient words of the Dedication to the Dark
One.</p>

<p>The chant told of the forty times forty
flights of onyx steps leading downward behind
the great altar to the dwelling place of
the Dark One and of the forty terrible beasts
couched in the pit to guard His slumber.</p>

<p>In the beginning, Dalir, the Sire, God of
the Mists, had gone down wrapped in a sea
fog, and had stolen the Sacred Fire while
the Dark One slept. All life in Darion had
come from Dalir's mystic union with the
Sacred Fire.</p>

<p>Centuries passed before a winter of bitter
frosts came, and the Dark One awakened
cold in His dwelling place and found the
Sacred Fire stolen. His wrath moved beneath
the city then, and Darion crashed in
shattered ruin and death.</p>

<p>Those who were left had hurled a maiden
screaming into the greatest of the clefts in
the earth, that the bed of the Idol might be
warmed by an ember of the stolen Fire.
Later, they had raised His awful Temple
on the spot.</p>

<p>So it had been, almost from the beginning.
When the pillars of the Temple
shook, a maiden was chosen by the Sacred
Lots to go down as a bride to the Dark
One, lest He destroy the city and the
people.</p>

<p>The chant had come to an end. The legend
had been told once more.</p>

<p>They led her forth then&mdash;Dura-ki, the
chosen one. Shod in golden sandals, and
wearing the crimson robe of the ritual, she
moved out of Ra-sed's sight, behind the high
altar. No acolyte was permitted to approach
that place.</p>

<p>The chanting was a thing of wild delirium
now, and Ra-set placed a cold hand to steady
himself against a trembling pillar. He heard
the drawing of the ancient bolts, the booming
echo as the great stone was drawn aside,
and he closed his eyes, as though that could
shut out the vision of the monstrous pit.</p>

<p>But his ears he could not close, and he
heard the scream of Dura-ki, his own betrothed,
as they threw her to the Idol.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_a.jpg" alt="A" width="36" height="40" /></div>
<p>t the table in the Yarotian pleasure
house, Ransome's thin lips were pale.
He swallowed his drink.</p>

<p>The woman opposite him was nearly forgotten
now, and when he went on, it was
for himself, to rid himself of things that
had haunted him down all the bleak worlds
to his final night of betrayal and death.
His eyes were empty, fixed on another life.
He did not see the change that crossed
Irene's face, did not see the cold contempt
fade away, to be replaced slowly with understanding.
She leaned forward, lips slightly
parted, to hear the end of his story.</p>

<p>For the love of golden-haired Dura-ki, the
acolyte, Ra-sed, had gone down into the
pit of the Dark one, where no mortal had
gone before, except as a sacrifice.</p>

<p>He had hidden himself in the gloom of
the pillars when the others left in chanting
procession after the ceremony. Now he was
wrenching at the rusted bolts that held the
stone in place. It seemed to him that the
rumbling grew in the earth beneath his feet
and in the blackness of the vaulting overhead.
Terror was in him, for his blasphemy
would bring death to Darion. But the vision
of Dura-ki was in him too, giving strength
to tortured muscles. The bolts came away
with a metallic screech, piercing against the
mutter of shifting stone.</p>

<p>He was turning to the heavy ring set in
the stone when he caught a glimmer of reflected
light in an idol's eye. Swiftly he
crouched behind the great stone, waiting.</p>

<p>The priests came, two of them, bearing
torches. Knives flashed as Ra-sed sprang, but
he wrenched the blade from the hand of the
first, buried it in the throat of the second.
The man fell with a cry, but a stunning
blow from behind sent Ra-sed sprawling
across the fallen body. The other priest was
on him, choking out his life.</p>

<p>The last torch fell; and Ra-sed twisted
savagely, lashed out blindly with the long
knife. There was a sound of rending cloth,
a muttered curse in the darkness, and the
fingers ground harder into Ra-sed's throat.
Black tides washed over his mind, and he
never remembered the second and last convulsive
thrust of the knife that let out the
life of the priest.</p>

<p>He did remember straining against the
ring of the great stone. The echo boomed
out for the second time that night, as the
stone moved away at last, to lay bare the
realm of the Dark One.</p>

<p>Bitterness touched Ransome's eyes as he
spoke now, the bitterness of a man who
has lost his God.</p>

<p>"There were no onyx steps, no monsters
waiting beneath the stone. The legends were
false."</p>

<p>Ransome turned his glass slowly, staring
into its amber depths. Then he became aware
of Irene, waiting for him to go on.</p>

<p>"I got her out," Ransome said shortly.
"I went down into that stinking pit and I
got Dura-ki out. The air was nearly unbreathable
where I found her. She was unconscious
on a ledge at the end of a long
slope. Hell itself might have been in the
pit that opened beneath it. A geologist
would have called it a major fault, but it
was hell enough. When I picked her up, I
found the bones of all those others...."</p>

<p>Irene's green eyes had lost their coldness.
She let her hand rest on his for a
moment. But her voice was puzzled.</p>

<p>"This Dura-ki&mdash;she is the woman on the
<i>Hawk of Darion</i>?"</p>

<p>Ransome nodded. He stood up. His lips
were a hard, thin line.</p>

<p>"My little story has an epilogue. Something
not quite so romantic. I lived with
Dura-ki in hiding near Darion for a year,
until a ship came in from space. A pirate
ship, with a tall, good-looking Earthman for
a master. I took passage for Dura-ki, and
signed on myself as a crewman. A fresh start
in a bright, new world." Ransome laughed
shortly. "I'll spare you the details of that
happy voyage. At the first port of call, on
Jupiter, Dura-ki stood at the top of the
gangway and laughed when her Captain
Jareth had me thrown off the ship."</p>

<p>"She betrayed you for the master of the
<i>Hawk of Darion</i>," Irene said softly.</p>

<p>"And tonight she'll pay," Ransome finished
coldly. He threw down a few coins
to pay for their drinks. "It's been pleasant
telling you my pretty little story."</p>

<p>"Ransome, wait. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Forget it," Ransome said.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_m.jpg" alt="M" width="42" height="40" /></div>
<p>ytor's car was waiting, and Ransome
could sense the presence of the guards
lurking in the dark, empty street.</p>

<p>"The spaceport," Ransome told his
driver. "Fast."</p>

<p>He thought of the note he had given the
crewman to deliver:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Ra-sed would see his beloved a last time
before he dies."</p></div>

<p>"Faster," Ransome grated, and the powerful
car leapt forward into the night.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_s.jpg" alt="S" width="26" height="40" /></div>
<p>hips, like the men who drove them,
came to Yaroto to die. Three quarters
of the spaceport was a vast jungle of looming
black shapes, most of them awaiting the
breaker's hammer. Ransome dismissed the
car and threaded his way through the deserted
yards with the certainty of a man
used to the ugly places of a hundred
worlds.</p>

<p>Mytor had suggested the meeting place,
a hulk larger than most, a cruiser once in
the fleet of some forgotten power.</p>

<p>Ransome had fought in the ships of half
a dozen worlds. Now the ancient cruiser
claimed his attention. Martian, by the cut of
her rusted braking fins. Ransome tensed, remembering
the charge of the Martian
cruisers in the Battle of Phoebus. Since then
he had called himself an Earthman, because,
even if his parentage had not given him
claim to that title already, a man who had
been in the Earth ships at Phoebus had a
right to it.</p>

<p>He was running a hand over the battered
plate of a blast tube when Dura-ki found
him. She was a smaller shadow moving
among the vast, dark hulls. With a curious,
dead feeling in him, Ransome stepped away
from the side of the cruiser to meet her.</p>

<p>"Ra-sed, I could not let you die alone&mdash;"</p>

<p>Because her voice was a ghost from the
past, because it stirred things in him that
had no right to live after all the long
years that had passed, Ransome acted before
Dura-ki could finish speaking. He hit
her once, hard; caught the crumpling body
in his arms, and started back toward Mytor's
car. If he remembered another journey in
the blackness with this woman in his arms,
he drove the memory back with the savage
blasphemies of a hundred worlds.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_o.jpg" alt="O" width="35" height="40" /></div>
<p>n the rough floor of Mytor's place,
Dura-ki stirred and groaned.</p>

<p>Ransome didn't like the way things were
going. He hadn't planned to return to the
Cafe Yaroto, to wait with Mytor for the
arrival of the priests.</p>

<p>"There are a couple of my men outside,"
Mytor told him. "When the priests are
spotted you can slip out through the rear
exit."</p>

<p>"Why the devil do I have to be here
now?"</p>

<p>"As I have told you, I am a businessman.
Until I have turned the girl over to the
priests I cannot be sure of my payment.
This girl, as you know, is not without
friends. If Captain Jareth knew that she was
here he would tear this place apart, he and
his crew. Those men have rather an impressive
reputation as fighters, and while
my guard here&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've been drinking too much of your
own rotten liquor, Mytor. Why should I
try to save her at the eleventh hour? To hand
her back to her lover?"</p>

<p>"I never drink my own liquor, Mr. Ransome."
He took a sip of his kali in confirmation.
"I have seen love take many
curious shapes."</p>

<p>Ransome stood up. "Save your memoirs.
I want a guard to get me to the ship you
promised me. And I want it now."</p>

<p>Mytor did not move. The guards, ranged
around the walls, stood silent but alert.</p>

<p>"Mytor."</p>

<p>"Yes, Mr. Ransome?"</p>

<p>"There isn't any ship. There never was."</p>

<p>The Venusian shrugged. "It would have
been easier for you if you hadn't guessed.
I'm really sorry."</p>

<p>"So you'll make a double profit on this
deal. I was the bait for Dura-ki, and Irene
was bait for me. You are a good businessman,
Mytor."</p>

<p>"You are taking this rather better than
I had expected, Mr. Ransome."</p>

<p>Ransome slumped down into his chair
again. He felt no fear, no emotion at all.
Somewhere, deep inside, he had known
from the beginning that there would be no
more running away after tonight, that the
priests would have their will with him. Perhaps
he had been too tired to care. And there
had been Irene, planted by Mytor to fill
his eyes, to make him careless and distracted.</p>

<p>He wondered if Irene had known of her
role, or had been an unconscious tool, like
himself. With faint surprise, he found
himself hoping that she had not acted
against him intentionally.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/image_d.jpg" alt="D" width="37" height="40" /></div>
<p>ura-ki was unconscious when the
priests came. She had looked at Ransome
only once, and he had stared down
at his hands.</p>

<p>Now she stood quietly between two of the
black-robed figures, watching as others
counted out gold coins into Mytor's grasping
palm. Her eyes betrayed neither hope nor
fear, and she did not shrink from the
burning, fanatical stares of the priests, nor
from their long knives. The pirate's consort
was not the girl who had screamed in
the dimness of the Temple when the Sacred
Lots were cast.</p>

<p>A priest touched Ransome's shoulder and
he started in spite of himself. He tried to
steady himself against the sudden chill that
seized him.</p>

<p>And then Dura-ki, who had called him
once to blasphemy, now called him to something
else.</p>

<p>"Stand up, Ra-sed. It is the end. The game
is played out and we lose at last. It will not
be worse than the pit of the Dark One."</p>

<p>Ransome got to his feet and looked at
her. He no longer loved this woman but
her quiet courage stirred him.</p>

<p>With an incredibly swift lunge he was
on the priest who stood nearest Dura-ki.
The man reeled backward and struck his
skull against the wall. It was a satisfying
sound, and Ransome smiled tightly, a half-forgotten
oath of Darion on his lips.</p>

<p>He grabbed the man by the throat, spun
him around, and sent him crashing into another.</p>

<p>A knife slashed at him, and he broke the
arm that held it, then sprang for the door
while the world exploded in blaster fire.</p>

<p>Dura-ki moved toward him. He wrenched
at the door, felt the cold night air rash in.
A hand clawed at the girl's shoulder, but
Ransome freed her with a hard, well-aimed
blow.</p>

<p>When she was outside, Ransome fought
to give her time to get back to the <i>Hawk
of Darion</i>. Also, he fought for the sheer
joy of it. The air in his lungs was fresh
again, and the taste of treachery was out of
his mouth.</p>

<p>It took all of Mytor's guards and the
priests to overpower him, but they were too
late to save Mytor from the knife that left
him gasping out his life on the floor.</p>

<p>Ransome did not struggle in the grip of
the guards. He stood quietly, waiting.</p>

<p>"Your death will not be made prettier by
what you have done," a priest told him. The
knife was poised.</p>

<p>"That depends on how you look at it,"
Ransome answered.</p>

<p>"Does it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely," a hard, dry voice answered
from the doorway.</p>

<p>Ransome turned his head and had a
glimpse of Irene. With her, a blaster level
in his hand, and his crew at his back, was
Captain Jareth. It was he who had answered
the priest's last question.</p>

<p>Mytor had said that Jareth's crew had
an impressive reputation as fighters, and he
lived just long enough to see the truth of
his words. The priests and the guards went
down before the furious attack of the men
from the <i>Hawk of Darion</i>. Ransome fought
as one of them.</p>

<p>When it was over, it was not to Captain
Jareth that he spoke, but to Irene.</p>

<p>"Why did you do this? You didn't know
Dura-ki, and you despised me."</p>

<p>"At first I did. That's why I agreed to
Mytor's plan. But when I had spoken to
you, I felt differently. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jareth came over then, holstering his
blaster. Irene fell silent.</p>

<p>The big spaceman shifted uneasily, then
spoke to Ransome.</p>

<p>"I found Dura-ki near here. She told me
what you did."</p>

<p>Ransome shrugged.</p>

<p>"I sent her back to the ship with a couple
of my men."</p>

<p>Abruptly, Jareth turned and stooped over
the still form of Mytor. From the folds of
the Venusian's stained tarab he drew a ring
of keys. He tossed them to Ransome.</p>

<p>"This will be the first promise that Mytor
ever kept."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Those are the keys to his private ship.
I'll see that you get to it."</p>

<p>It was Irene who spoke then. "That wasn't
all that Mytor promised him."</p>

<p>The two men looked at her in surprise.
Then Ransome understood.</p>

<p>"Will you come with me, Irene?" he asked
her.</p>

<p>"Where?" Her eyes were shining, and
she looked very young.</p>

<p>Ransome smiled at her. "The Galaxy is
full of worlds. And even the Dark One
cancels his debts when the night of Bani-tai
is over."</p>

<p>"Let's go and look at some of those
worlds," Irene said.</p>
